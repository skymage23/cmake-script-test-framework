Do not remove this file. It's here so that the directory remains part of the repo.

This directory is used to make sure backreference relative path resolution works
properly. See "tests/test_files/test-file-dot-backreference-in-filepath.cmake" to see how this directory
is used.

It's also used to test CMake variable expansion.
